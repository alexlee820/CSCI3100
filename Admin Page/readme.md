# The administration page for the Bus Management System

## Running the project
1. Make sure [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) is installed. (Or you can use any other web servers.)
2. Start the [backend API](https://github.com/RitoGamingPLZ/CSCI3100/tree/master/Backend).
3. Run `http-server` in **this directory**.
4. Open the browser (Google Chrome is suggested). Type `http://localhost:8080/`.
5. You can see if the admin page successfully connects to the backend API by the *server status* badge.

## Hosting
The admin page is hosted on [Google Compute Engine](http://35.201.158.77/).
